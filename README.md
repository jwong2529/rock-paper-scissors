# rock-paper-scissors
This is the third project in the The Odin Project foundations curriculum and is a basic rock-paper-scissors game. 

This project will start with the game being playable only through the browser console. In a couple lessons, I will implement a proper GUI for the game.

The main objective is to practice working with Javascript.
