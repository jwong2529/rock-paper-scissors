# rock-paper-scissors
This is the third project in the The Odin Project foundations curriculum and is a basic rock-paper-scissors game. 

This project started with the game being playable only through the browser console. I implemented a proper GUI after a couple of lessons.

The main objective is to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the same time. For the JavaScript portion, I am focusing on DOM manipulation and event listeners.
